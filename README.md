> Some scrapers recognize the redirect and will index that destination page instead.  
> If this happens, use this URL instead:  
> `https://brainn11.github.io/MandelbrotVideo/video`  
> It simply leads to a version of the page without the redirect.  
> This does mean that if the URL in the message is clicked directly, the user does not get redirected!
